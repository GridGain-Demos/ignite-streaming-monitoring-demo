# Apache Ignite Market Orders Streaming Demo

The demo starts a simple application that simulates trading activities of a stock exchange. The application receives executed
market deals in real-time from the
[PubNub Market Order Data Stream](https://www.pubnub.com/developers/realtime-data-streams/financial-securities-market-orders/)
and forwards the deals to a locally running Ignite cluster.

The demo is created for the Apache Ignite Management and Monitoring With Control Center tutorial. Follow the steps of the
tutorial to learn how to work with the demo: https://www.gridgain.com/docs/tutorials/management-monitoring/overview
