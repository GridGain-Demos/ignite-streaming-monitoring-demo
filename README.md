# Apache Ignite Market Orders Streaming Demo

The demo starts a simple application that simulates trading activities of a stock exchange. The application receives executed
market deals in real-time from the
[PubNub Market Order Data Stream](https://www.pubnub.com/developers/realtime-data-streams/financial-securities-market-orders/)
and forwards the deals to a locally running Ignite cluster.

The demo is created for the Control Center [written tutorial](https://www.gridgain.com/docs/tutorials/management-monitoring/overview) and [instructor-led foundation course](https://www.gridgain.com/products/services/training/how-monitor-and-manage-apache-ignite-gridgain-control-center).
